@subsection rn2004_Constraints Constraints and Limitations

@subsubsection rn2004_ConstraintsLinuxSupport Dev Machine Linux Version

To develop applications within the Legato Application Framework, a current supported
[Long Term Support version of Ubuntu Linux](https://www.ubuntu.com/info/release-end-of-life) is
required on your dev machine (or running in a virtual box on Windows).  Ubuntu 18.04 is the current
@b recommended version to use on your dev machine.

@subsubsection rn2004_ConstECMUSB ECM-USB modem manager issue

Ubuntu 15.10 and newer has Modem Manager version @c 1.4.12-1ubuntu1  installed by default which
conflicts with the ECM-USB driver when connecting a target.  Modem manager may cause the Ubuntu
Network Manager to crash on your host and/or your target device to become unavailable over USB.

@b Symptoms:
- NetworkManager crashing when plugging into your device over USB, or
- The target device becomes inaccessible after 30 seconds.

@b Recommended  @b Work  @b Around:
- Uninstall @c modemmanager from Ubuntu or
- [Downgrade @c modemmanager to version 1.0.0-2ubuntu1](http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/modemmanager)

@subsubsection rn2004_ConstTrust FOTA upgrade warning

A device that has trustzones enabled, may re-bootstrap (obtain new keys from the AirVantage server)
durring a FOTA (firmware over-the-air) upgrade.
