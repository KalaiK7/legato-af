config CUSTOM_FA_PATH
  string "Path to custom OS adaptor sources directory"
  depends on CUSTOM_FA
  ---help---
  Path of custom OS adaptor source directory relative to the legato/ root
  directory.  This source directory should contain liblegato/ and daemons/
  directories containing the source code needed to support the custom
  operating system.

config BUILD_TARGET_TOOLS
  bool "Build on-target command-line tools"
  default n if CUSTOM_OS
  default y

  depends on RTOS && BUILD_TARGET_TOOLS
  default n
  ---help---
  Select this if you want to build and install the "dlsum" tool.  This tool

  prompt "Static log level filter"
  default LOG_STATIC_FILTER_INFO if REDUCE_FOOTPRINT
  default LOG_STATIC_FILTER_DEBUG
  ---help---
  Select the static filter for log statements.  Log statements with a lower
  priority than this level will be omitted from compiled code.

endchoice # end "Static log level filter"

config ENABLE_SEGV_HANDLER
  bool "Enable SIGSEGV handler"
  depends on LINUX
  default y
  ---help---
  When a segmentation fault occurs, use signal derivation and
  sigsetjmp()/siglongjmp() to try and survive the invalid memory access long
  enough to generate a backtrace.  This handler relies on undefined behaviour
  of sigsetjmp() and is therefore not guaranteed to work.

config ENABLE_BACKTRACE
  bool "Enable Legato assertion backtraces"
  default y
  ---help---
  Print backtraces when a Legato assertion is triggered.  This can be helpful
  in debugging errors.

config USE_GUARD_BAND
  bool "Enable memory guard bands"
  default y
  ---help---
  Insert chunks of memory into each allocated memory block before and after
  the user data portion.  These "guard bands" are filled with a special
  pattern that is unlikely to occur in normal data.  Whenever a block is
  allocated or released, the guard bands are checked for corruption and any
  corruption is reported.

config NUM_GUARD_BAND_WORDS
  int "Number of guard band words"
  depends on USE_GUARD_BAND
  range 1 8
  default 1 if REDUCE_FOOTPRINT
  default 8

  inserted before and after every memory allocation, increasing the allocation
  size in words by NUM_GUARD_BAND_WORDS * 2.

config MEM_POOL_STATS
  bool "Track memory pool statistics"
  default n if REDUCE_FOOTPRINT
  default y
  ---help---
  Track memory pool statistics which are not needed during runtime.  These
  are:
   - Number of overflows
   - Number of allocations
   - Maximum blocks used

config THREAD_SETNAME
  bool "Set names of threads created from Legato"
  default y
  ---help---
  Use Legato thread names as the names for underlying OS threads as well.
  This has no effect if the OS does not allow setting thread names.  If Legato
  thread names are disabled, this will just set the name to "<legato>."

config NAMES_ENABLED
  bool "Enable names in Legato objects"
  default y
  ---help---
  Add name fields to Legato objects (mutexes, threads, memory pools, etc)
  for logging, debugging, and tracing purposes.  Turning this off will
  reduce RAM usage at the expense of traceability.

config FD_MONITOR_NAMES_ENABLED
  bool "Enable names in file descriptor monitors"
  depends on NAMES_ENABLED
  default n if REDUCE_FOOTPRINT
  default y
  ---help---
  Add a name field to Legato file descriptor monitors.

config SEM_NAMES_ENABLED
  bool "Enable names in semaphores"
  depends on NAMES_ENABLED

  default y
  ---help---
  Add a name field to Legato semaphores.

  default y
  ---help---
  Add a name field to Legato memory pools.

config MEM_TRACE
  bool "Enable memory pool tracing"
  depends on MEM_POOL_NAMES_ENABLED
  default n
  ---help---
  If enabled, the memory subsystem will create a trace point for every memory
  pool created.  The name of the tracepoint will be the same of the pool, and
  is of the form "component.poolName".

config TIMER_NAMES_ENABLED
  bool "Enable names in timers"
  depends on NAMES_ENABLED
  default n if REDUCE_FOOTPRINT
  default y
  ---help---
  Add a name field to Legato timers.

config EVENT_NAMES_ENABLED
  bool "Enable names in events"
  depends on NAMES_ENABLED
  default n if REDUCE_FOOTPRINT
  default y
  ---help---
  Add a name field to Legato event IDs.

config HASHMAP_NAMES_ENABLED
  bool "Enable names in hashmaps"
  depends on NAMES_ENABLED
  default n if REDUCE_FOOTPRINT
  default y
  ---help---
  Add a name field to Legato hashmaps.  Disabling this also disables
  hashmap tracing.

config SAFE_REF_NAMES_ENABLED
  bool "Enable names in safe references"
  depends on NAMES_ENABLED
  default n if REDUCE_FOOTPRINT
  default y
  ---help---
  Add a name field to Legato safe references.

config REDUCE_FOOTPRINT
  bool "Reduce memory and storage use where possible"
  default n
  ---help---
  Try to reduce the memory and storage footprint of Legato.  This may use
  alternate data structures which are optimized for size and reduce the scale
  of some tests.  Selecting this option may result in lower performance and
  slower applications.

config MEM_POOLS
  bool "Use memory pools"
  default y
  ---help---
  Use memory pools for dynamic memory allocation.  Memory pools help prevent
  memory fragmentation, but require that the pools be sized appropriately for
  the application.
  Disabling this option will still allocate memory using the memory pool
  interface (le_mem), but switches the internal behaviour to use malloc and
  free on a per-block basis.  This allows tools like Valgrind to accurately
  track the allocations and de-allocations at the cost of potential memory
  fragmentation.

config MAX_EVENT_POOL_SIZE
  int "Maximum event pool size"
  depends on MEM_POOLS

  which all FD monitor objects are allocated.

  int "Maximum memory pool sub-pools"
  depends on MEM_POOLS

  default 8
  ---help---

  are control structures used for managing the subdivision of memory pools.

config MAX_MUTEX_POOL_SIZE
  int "Maximum mutex pool size"
  depends on MEM_POOLS
  range 1 65535
  default 20

  depends on MEM_POOLS
  range 1 65535
  default 40
  ---help---
  The maximum number of timer objects in the process-wide timer pool, from
  which all Legato timers are allocated.

config MAX_PATH_ITERATOR_POOL_SIZE
  int "Maximum path iterator count"
  depends on MEM_POOLS
  range 1 65535
  default 10
  ---help---
  The maximum number of path iterator in the process-wide iterator pools, from
  which all Legato path iterators are allocated.

config MAX_MSG_LOCAL_CLIENT_SESSION_POOL_SIZE
